Permit and compliance application for the State of Alaska created with EPA Exchange Grant funds.   It's a work in progress and only allows for the entry of data and not editing.   also it uses a DLL called the DROPS Business layer which is specific to the DEC DROPS database and would need to be re-built using your own database schema.
